Short answer: because repeatable troubleshooting beats tribal knowledge.

In this blog I’ll share:
- Quick BGP/EVPN recipes (IOS-XR, JunOS, EOS, NX-OS)
- Lab notes that actually *work* on fresh devices/containers
- Clean diagrams and “copy/paste then tweak” snippets

Stay tuned—next post is a compact EVPN VXLAN lab you can run on a laptop.
